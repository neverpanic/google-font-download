# google-font-download

This is a small shell script that allows you to download Google's web fonts to
your local file system. Additionally, a CSS file that uses your local copy of
the fonts is generated. You may want to use this if you want to avoid
requesting resources from 3rd party servers (for example for privacy reasons or
because you do not have a connection to the public internet).

## Requirements

To run this script, you will need:

 - Bash (>= 4.x)
 - curl
 - getopt, preferrably a version that preserves quoted whitespace and supports long options
 - tput
 - fmt
 - sed, in a version that has extended regex support using either `-E` (BSD) or `-r` (GNU)
 - awk
 - tr
 - grep
 - perl

The script is released under the 2-clause BSD license. The SPDX identifier of

## Usage

### Synopsis
  `google-font-download [OPTION...] [FONT...]`

### Options

<dl>
    <dt><code>-u URL</code>, <code>--url=URL</code></dt>
    <dd>Dowload the fonts specified in the URL. Note: You can mix it with normal arguments (See below).</dd>
    <dt><code>-f FORMAT</code>, <code>--format=FORMAT</code></dt>
    <dd>Download the specified set of webfont formats from Google's servers.
        <code>FORMAT</code> is a comma-separated list of identifiers for
        webfont formats. Supported identifiers are <code>eot</code>,
        <code>woff</code>, <code>woff2</code>, <code>svg</code>, and
        <code>ttf</code>. Additionally, the special value <code>all</code>
        expands to all supported formats. The default is <code>all</code>. Note
        that you may not really need all formats. In most cases, WOFF is enough.
        See http://caniuse.com/#search=woff for a current status.</dd>
    <dt><code>-h</code>, <code>--help</code></dt>
    <dd>Display this message and exit.</dd>

        <code>cyrillic-ext</code>, <code>greek</code>, <code>greek-ext</code>,
        etc. An undocumented language is <code>all</code> which means the full

    <dt><code>-o OUTPUT</code>, <code>--output=OUTPUT</code></dt>
    <dd>Write the generated CSS into <code>OUTPUT</code>. The file will be
        overwritten and will be created if it doesn't exist. The default is
        <code>font.css</code>.</dd>
</dl>

### Positional Arguments
  This script accepts an arbitrary number of font specs. A font spec consists
  of a font name as accepted by Google's servers, optionally followed by
  a colon, an optional font weight in numbers or the string "bold" and an
  optional font style of "italic" (or "i") for italics. In [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form):

  ```ebnf
  url = URL
  fontspec = fontname, [ ":", [ fontweight ], [ fontstyle ] ]
  fontweight = number | "bold"
  number = { digit }
  digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
  fontstyle = "italic" | "i"
  ```

  While Google's servers will accept other inputs and abbreviations for font
  weight and font style, they are not supported by this script.

  Note: if you don't use the URL argument, your font spec should *not* be URL-encoded and only one font weight
  is supported per font specification. If you want to download multiple font
  weights or styles, provide multiple font specs.

  For example, to download Open Sans in
   - light (300),
   - normal (400),
   - normal italic (400italic),
   - bold (700), and
   - bold italic (700italic),
  run:
```bash
google-font-download \
    "Open Sans:300" "Open Sans:400" "Open Sans:400italic" \
    "Open Sans:700" "Open Sans:700italic"
```
or in URL format:
```bash
google-font-download --url="https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Open+Sans:300,400,400i,700,700i"
```
You can also mix the arguments:
```bash
google-font-download --url="https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Open+Sans:300,400,400i" \
"Open Sans:700" "Open Sans:700i"
```
